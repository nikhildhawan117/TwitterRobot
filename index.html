	<p>“An expressive robot that brings social media interaction into the physical world.”</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Social Media outlets like Twitter and Facebook have become dominating players in the field of human interaction. Indeed many interactions have become mediated by digital technology. We believe the loss of the physical component of interaction has had negative effects on human relationships overall. Current research studies agree that people become more isolated through use of social media.

	<p>
		Our project aims to explore potential solutions to the lack of physical feedback in the world of social media. We built an emotionally expressive robot which physically reacts to Tweets in a live setting. Users can tweet to the robot’s Twitter account and receive near instant feedback as the robot, plays a sound, moves on its surface, displays the tweet text, shows a facial expression, lights up with different colors and intensities to convey its feelings about the tweet. 
	</p>
	<h2>High Level Design</h2>
	<p>
		A server application running on a laptop computer monitors the robot’s Twitter account in real time. When a tweet is received, the server processes the content and fits the text to an emotion. The twitter user ID, tweet content, and emotion are all sent to the robot via a wireless bluetooth serial connection whereupon the robot displays the information and maps the emotion to a predetermined set of outputs for each of the possible emotions.
